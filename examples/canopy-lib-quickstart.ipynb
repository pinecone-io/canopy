      "document: ### p2 pods\\n\\n\\nThe p2 pod type provides greater query throughput with lower latency. For vectors with fewer than 128 dimension and queries where `topK` is less than 50, p2 pods support up to 200 QPS per replica and return queries in less than 10ms. This means that query throughput and latency are better than s1 and p1.\\n\\n\\nEach p2 pod has enough capacity for around 1M vectors of 768 dimensions. However, capacity may vary with dimensionality.\\n\\n\\nThe data ingestion rate for p2 pods is significantly slower than for p1 pods; this rate decreases as the number of dimensions increases. For example, a p2 pod containing vectors with 128 dimensions can upsert up to 300 updates per second; a p2 pod containing vectors with 768 dimensions or more supports upsert of 50 updates per second. Because query latency and throughput for p2 pods vary from p1 pods, test p2 pod performance with your dataset.\\n\\n\\nThe p2 pod type does not support sparse vector values.\n",
